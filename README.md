The Odin Project Recipe Project - HTML | CSS

The goal of this project is to create an HTML-based webpage containing three recipes.
The learning objective is to utilize the HTML lessons in The Odin Project's Foundations course, which includes formatting paragraphs, adding links and images, and using ordered and unordered lists.

This project was more time consuming that I anticipated, however after making the third recipe page I realized it might have been more efficient to make a recipe page template that could be copied over for n recipes in the future.
